# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Picture Press is a new feature for SEO Foundry that provides users with a streamlined image format conversion tool. Similar to Pixel Forge's visual asset generation capabilities, Picture Press focuses on bulk image format conversion with an intuitive interface for uploading multiple images, selecting output formats, configuring naming conventions, and downloading converted results. The feature leverages ImageMagick for high-quality conversions and reuses existing UI components and infrastructure from Pixel Forge to maintain consistency and reduce development overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to upload multiple images at once, so that I can efficiently convert batches of images without individual uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Picture Press page THEN the system SHALL display an upload area that accepts multiple image files
2. WHEN a user drags and drops multiple image files THEN the system SHALL accept all supported image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, BMP)
3. WHEN a user selects files via file picker THEN the system SHALL allow multiple file selection
4. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes using the same security constraints as Pixel Forge
5. WHEN invalid files are included THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and allow valid files to proceed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to convert my images to different formats, so that I can optimize them for various platforms and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has uploaded images THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with format conversion options
2. WHEN a user selects an output format THEN the system SHALL support common web formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, TIFF, BMP)
3. WHEN a user initiates conversion THEN the system SHALL use ImageMagick for high-quality format conversion
4. WHEN conversion is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress updates similar to Pixel Forge
5. WHEN conversion completes THEN the system SHALL display converted images with metadata (dimensions, file size, format)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple images, I want to configure naming conventions for converted files, so that I can maintain organized file structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses naming options THEN the system SHALL provide options to keep original names or apply custom naming patterns
2. WHEN a user chooses custom naming THEN the system SHALL support patterns like prefix/suffix addition, sequential numbering, and format-based naming
3. WHEN a user selects "keep original names" THEN the system SHALL preserve original filenames with only format extension changes
4. WHEN naming conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL automatically append numbers to ensure unique filenames
5. WHEN preview is available THEN the system SHALL show filename preview before conversion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user working with converted images, I want to preview and download individual or bulk download converted images in a zip, so that I can selectively use the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL display converted images in a grid layout similar to Pixel Forge's ResultGrid
2. WHEN a user clicks on an image THEN the system SHALL display a larger preview with metadata
3. WHEN a user wants individual downloads THEN the system SHALL provide download buttons for each converted image
4. WHEN a user wants bulk download THEN the system SHALL provide a "Download All" option that creates a ZIP archive
5. WHEN downloads are initiated THEN the system SHALL serve files through secure, session-scoped URLs similar to Pixel Forge

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user concerned about security and performance, I want the conversion process to be secure and efficient, so that my images are protected and processing is fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads images THEN the system SHALL enforce the same rate limiting and security measures as Pixel Forge
2. WHEN conversion is processing THEN the system SHALL use per-session concurrency locks to prevent duplicate operations
3. WHEN files are served THEN the system SHALL use session-scoped file access with path traversal protection
4. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up uploaded and converted files
5. WHEN ImageMagick is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative processing methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want Picture Press to reuse existing Pixel Forge infrastructure, so that code duplication is minimized and consistency is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Picture Press THEN the system SHALL reuse Pixel Forge's session management utilities
2. WHEN implementing UI components THEN the system SHALL reuse UploadArea, ResultGrid, and SidebarOptions components with appropriate modifications
3. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL reuse existing rate limiting and concurrency control mechanisms
4. WHEN implementing file serving THEN the system SHALL follow the same secure file serving pattern as Pixel Forge
5. WHEN implementing testing THEN the system SHALL follow the same testing patterns and coverage standards as Pixel Forge
