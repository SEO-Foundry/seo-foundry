# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Pixel Forge Integration feature replaces the existing mock image generation system in SEO Foundry's pixel-forge page with real pixel-forge package integration. This enables users to upload brand assets and generate actual SEO-optimized web assets (favicons, PWA icons, social media images, meta tags) using the existing UI components and pixel-forge's programmatic API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want the existing upload functionality to work with real pixel-forge processing, so that I can generate actual website assets instead of mock variants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image using the existing UploadArea component THEN the system SHALL store the image file for server-side processing
2. WHEN the image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing preview functionality
3. WHEN a user clears the upload THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files on the server
4. IF the uploaded file cannot be processed by pixel-forge THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a valid image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL enable pixel-forge generation options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want the sidebar options to reflect pixel-forge's actual generation capabilities, so that I can select the specific asset types I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pixel-forge page loads THEN the system SHALL update SidebarOptions to display pixel-forge generation types (favicon, pwa, social, seo, web, all, and more)
2. WHEN a user selects "Generate All" THEN the system SHALL pass the --all flag equivalent to pixel-forge
3. WHEN a user selects specific generation types THEN the system SHALL pass the corresponding flags to pixel-forge
4. WHEN generation options are selected THEN the system SHALL display expected file counts based on pixel-forge documentation
5. WHEN advanced options are available THEN the system SHALL provide fields for app name, description, and theme color
6. Investigate the pixel-forge documentation for more information on advanced options and capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want a tRPC API that processes images with pixel-forge on the server, so that the existing generate button triggers real asset generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the generate button THEN the system SHALL call a tRPC procedure that processes the image with pixel-forge
2. WHEN the tRPC procedure executes THEN the system SHALL use pixel-forge's programmatic API with the selected generation options
3. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing progress indicator functionality
4. IF pixel-forge processing fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error information to the client
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL return file URLs and metadata for display in the existing ResultGrid

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want the existing ResultGrid to display real pixel-forge assets, so that I can preview and download actual generated files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pixel-forge generation completes THEN the system SHALL populate the existing ResultGrid with real asset data
2. WHEN assets are displayed THEN the system SHALL show actual file names, dimensions, and purposes (favicon, PWA, social, etc.)
3. WHEN a user clicks download on an individual file THEN the system SHALL serve the actual generated file
4. WHEN a user clicks "Download All" THEN the system SHALL create a ZIP archive of all generated pixel-forge assets
5. WHEN meta-tags.html is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in a dedicated section with copy functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to provide custom app metadata for pixel-forge generation, so that the generated PWA manifests and meta tags reflect my brand identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar options are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide optional input fields for app name, description, and theme color
2. WHEN custom metadata is provided THEN the system SHALL pass these values to pixel-forge's generateMetadata option
3. WHEN app name is specified THEN pixel-forge SHALL include it in generated PWA manifest and meta tags
4. WHEN theme color is specified THEN pixel-forge SHALL apply it to PWA manifest and meta tag generation
5. IF no custom metadata is provided THEN pixel-forge SHALL use its default metadata generation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to understand what each generated asset is for, so that I can properly integrate them into my website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are displayed in ResultGrid THEN the system SHALL show descriptive labels indicating asset purpose (favicon, PWA icon, social image, etc.). The files generated have descriptive names, so we should show the name of the file in the preview
2. WHEN a user views generated files THEN the system SHALL group them by category (favicons, PWA assets, social media, SEO)
3. WHEN meta-tags.html is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in a dedicated code block with copy-to-clipboard functionality
4. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL show a summary of total files and categories generated
5. WHEN displaying asset information THEN the system SHALL include file dimensions and intended usage context
6. WHEN a user clicks on one of the preview images, the system will open a lightbox preview of that image

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want proper error handling for pixel-forge integration failures, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pixel-forge processing fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages from the pixel-forge API
2. WHEN ImageMagick is not available THEN the system SHALL display installation instructions for server administrators
3. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options
4. WHEN tRPC procedures fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed errors server-side and show user-friendly messages client-side
5. WHEN temporary file cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log warnings without affecting user experience

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to see accurate progress feedback during asset generation, so that I understand how long the process will take and what's currently happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pixel-forge generation begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar that reflects actual generation progress
2. WHEN pixel-forge processes individual asset types THEN the system SHALL update progress based on completed vs total operations
3. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display the current operation being performed (e.g., "Generating favicons...", "Creating PWA assets...")
4. WHEN pixel-forge provides progress events THEN the system SHALL use them to calculate accurate percentage completion
5. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL show 100% progress before displaying results

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want the existing clear/reset functionality to work with real pixel-forge assets, so that I can start fresh for different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the existing clear functionality is used THEN the system SHALL clean up server-side temporary files and generated assets
2. WHEN the session is reset THEN the system SHALL clear the ResultGrid and return to the initial upload state
3. WHEN starting a new generation THEN the system SHALL not display assets from previous pixel-forge generations
4. WHEN temporary files are cleaned up THEN the system SHALL ensure no orphaned files remain on the server
5. WHEN clearing results THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing UI behavior and transitions
