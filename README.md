## SEO Foundry Web App

This repository is the developer-facing web application for the SEO Foundry toolkit. It provides a Next.js front-end for interacting with the underlying SEO packages (for example, `pixel-forge`) that live in a separate monorepo.

Use this README if you are developing the site itself or integrating new package-backed features into the UI.

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10+ (this repo uses pnpm; prefer it over npm/yarn)

### Run locally
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# App runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Common scripts
```bash
pnpm typecheck   # TypeScript
pnpm lint        # ESLint
pnpm build       # Next.js production build
pnpm preview     # Build + start locally
pnpm format:check
pnpm format:write
```

Environment: no required variables for local dev by default. Validation is configured in `src/env.js`. You can set `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` to bypass during CI or Docker builds.

---

## Architecture (high level)
- Next.js App Router (TypeScript)
- tRPC for typed API calls between client and server
- Tailwind CSS

Key files:
- `src/app/page.tsx` – landing page
- `src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` – tRPC request handler
- `src/server/api` – tRPC router definitions
- `src/trpc/` – tRPC client setup

---

## Integrating toolkit packages
This site surfaces capabilities from packages in the SEO Foundry monorepo (for example, `pixel-forge`). Choose one of the following workflows depending on where you are developing:

### 1) Working inside the monorepo (recommended for active package dev)
- Place this app alongside `packages/*` in the monorepo (for example, `apps/site`).
- Ensure the monorepo `pnpm-workspace.yaml` includes the app and packages:

```yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

- Import package APIs directly from the workspace (no registry publish needed).

### 2) Working in this repo standalone
- Use the package as a Git submodule or as a local path dependency.
  - Submodule example (inside this repo):
    ```bash
    git submodule add https://github.com/devints47/pixel-forge.git packages/pixel-forge
    ```
  - Local path dependency (when the package is nearby on disk):
    ```bash
    pnpm add ../pixel-forge
    ```

---

## Adding a new feature backed by a package
1. Expose the capability on the server via tRPC in `src/server/api/routers/*`.
2. Consume it on the client using the tRPC hooks in `src/trpc/react.tsx`.
3. If the feature relies on a workspace package, import it directly (monorepo) or via the configured dependency (standalone).

---

## Deployment
- Build artifacts are generated by `pnpm build`.
- Deploy on Vercel or any Node.js host. Ensure runtime environment variables (if added) are set.
